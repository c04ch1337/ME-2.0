Next Steps for ME-2.0
Based on the project's current state (v1.3 skill doc, repo structure, hybrid design), here's a phased roadmap to advance from planning to full deployment and evolution. This draws from agentic AI best practices in 2025, emphasizing iteration, testing, and scaling.

Repo & Environment Setup (1-2 Days):

Push the me-2.0 folder to GitHub; add LICENSE (MIT) and CI workflow for tests.
Run node-specific scripts: setup_ubuntu.sh on rig (installs Docker/NVIDIA, clones repos like ChatRouter); setup_laptop.ps1 on ThinkPad.
Edit .env: Add keys (TWILIO, OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3, MEM0_USER_ID=me).
Launch containers: docker compose up -d --build per node (ubuntu.yml for rig, etc.).
Verify: docker ps shows n8n, Mem0, Ollama running; test Ollama with curl http://localhost:11434.


Component Integration & Testing (3-5 Days):

Import n8n workflows (e.g., basic-voice-schedule.json) via UI (localhost:5678 on rig).
Configure ChatRouter: Clone/install (Go/Node/Wails), add model endpoints (e.g., Ollama), enable MCP for agent routing; test chat interface.
Integrate agents: Run STRIX/Factory AI CLIs; link via n8n Exec nodes. Test Mem0: python run_mem0.py, add/get memories via API.
Unit tests: python agent_orchestrator.py for STRIX/ChatRouter/Mem0 chain. Add Bolna for voice: Configure Twilio webhook to n8n.
Hybrid sync: Set webhooks (laptop â†’ cloud); simulate failover by shutting nodes.


End-to-End Workflows & HOT Mode (1 Week):

Build core flows in n8n: Voice scheduling (Twilio â†’ Bolna transcribe â†’ Calendar), pentesting (DreamLit email â†’ STRIX â†’ Factory report).
Enable HOT: Add crons for daily checks; use Mem0 for learning (e.g., store prefs).
Integration tests: Simulate day (call â†’ schedule â†’ notify); stress with multiple tasks.
Security audit: Run STRIX on system; encrypt data.


Deployment & Monitoring (Ongoing):

Deploy: Lightsail as hub; monitor with CloudWatch/Docker stats. Scale: Add NGINX for SSL.
Operationalize: Backup volumes; set alerts for downtime. Integrate ELON skill: Prompt Ollama for strategic advice (e.g., "What would Elon do to optimize?").
Evolve: Use Factory AI to code new agents (e.g., finance); audit data, refine reasoning pipelines.



Track in changelog.md; iterate based on tests. If stuck, query hardware or add tools like RDKit for chem agents. ðŸš€11 web pages3.8sQuestion: Will I be able to integrate any of the agents with 3rd party tools on another container? Will this design eventually be controlled all from the ChatRouter via chatbox or through voice call?Thought for 36sYes, ME-2.0 agents can integrate with third-party tools running in another Docker container. The design uses n8n for orchestration, which supports HTTP/API nodes, webhooks, and custom scripts to call external services (e.g., via Exec or Function nodes). Containers communicate over Docker networks or exposed ports; for example, link a third-party tool (like a database or API server) via volumes, environment vars, or HTTP endpoints in your compose files. Extend agents like Factory AI (for code gen) or STRIX (pentest) by routing calls through ChatRouter's MCP protocol, which enables HTTP/SSE/Stdio connections to third-party tools.
Yes, the design can evolve to centralize control via ChatRouter's chatbox (its desktop app interface already supports real-time user chats for model/tool interactions) or voice calls (integrate Twilio/Bolna outputs into ChatRouter via n8n workflows and MCP). Start with prototypes: Route voice transcripts to ChatRouter for agent handling, then respond via voice. This fits the phased approachâ€”test in v1.3, scale in future iterations.
